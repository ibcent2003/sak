                    <h6>Electrical Safety Taster</h6>
                    <p>HIPOT, ground bond, line leakage tester and more Electrical engineering is a field of engineering that generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. The field first became an identifiable occupation in the late nineteenth century after commercialization of the electric telegraph and electrical power supply. It now covers a range of subtopic including power, electronics, control system, signal processing and telecommunications.</p>
                    <p>
                        Electrical engineering may include electronic Engineering. where a distinction is made, electrical engineering is considered to deal with the problems associated with large-scale electrical systems such as power transmission and motor control, whereas electronic engineering deals with the study of small-scale electronic system including computers and integrated circuit. Alternatively, electrical engineering are usually concerned with using electricity to transmit energy, while electronic engineers are concerned with using electricity to process information. More recently, the distinction has become blurred by the growth of power electronics.
                        Electrical engineering typically possess an academic degree with a major in electrical engineering. The length of study for such a degree is usually four or five years and the completed degree may be designated as a bachelor of engineering, Bachelor of Science, bachelor of technology or bachelor of applied science depending upon the university. The degree generally includes units covering physics, mathematics, computer science, project management and specific topic in electrical engineering. Initially such topic cover most, if not all, of the sub-disciplines of electrical engineering. Students then choose specialize in one or more sub-disciplines towards the end of the degree.
